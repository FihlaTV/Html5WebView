# Html5WebView
Android WebView

WebView should be used very frequently in current projects. I personally feel that HTML5 is a trend. I found something and summarized it here.

The Html5WebView in this demo can be copied and used directly, and there is a simple way to use it in Html5Activity. For more specific settings, see the article introduction.
